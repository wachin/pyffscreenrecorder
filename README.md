## Screencast





## Join videos (Status not impremented yet)

The join the videos get on top of the script:

â†’ join-mkv.sh

the videos will be joined into the folder:

ðŸ—€ recorded-videos

if for some reason you need the initial videos they will be in the folder:

ðŸ—€ Old

script to joind the videos:

```
./join-mkv.sh 
```



**Other FFmpeg options** I have made this program so that it records with the videos in the mkv format because it gave me the best results, but you can record with mp4 by copying some of the profiles that are in the folder:

ðŸ—€ Profiles

where there are also profiles to record in full screen, example:

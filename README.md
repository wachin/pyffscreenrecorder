Capture and record your screen with ffmpeg ussing this Python GUI



and working with record the screen in a rectangle of 854x480:

this rectangle can be moved around the screen to capture what matters most to you

## Features



- Record rectangle

- Record in format: mkv
- Record in format: mp4 (it is necessary to paste the corresponding profile inside the folder ðŸ—€ Profiles)
- Record in Full Screen (it is necessary to paste the corresponding profile iside the folder ðŸ—€ Profiles)

# Dependencies



```
sudo apt install ffmpeg git clex pv
```



I suggest to use the Clex File Manager for command line usage, but you can also use: "nnn" or some terminal such as: xfce4-terminal, gnome-terminal, konsole, tilix, qterminal, etc, etc

# Installation



I suggest that you clone this project into some folder, and that you know that this program will always be cloned there:

```
git clone https://github.com/wachin/ffmpeg-screencast
```



next you must enter from a terminal into the cloned repository:

```
cd ffmpeg-screencast
```



write in the terminal and hit Enter:



## Screencast



Under clex first get on top of the script:



to stop with:

âŒ¨ Ctrl + C

To record another video repeat the process.



## Join videos



To join the videos get on top of the script:

â†’ join-mkv.sh

and hit Enter twice, and wait a bit, the videos will be joined into the folder:

ðŸ—€ recorded-videos

if for some reason you need the initial videos they will be in the folder:

ðŸ—€ Old

## To use it with a terminal



To use with some Linux terminal, just write the name of the script and execute with ENTER like:

**Screencast**

```
./ffmpeg-yuv444p-losseless-mkv.sh
```



You can help with tab to [autocomplete commands](https://www.computerhope.com/tips/tip176.htm)





**Join videos**

```
./join-mkv.sh 
```



**Other FFmpeg options** I have made this program so that it records with the videos in the mkv format because it gave me the best results, but you can record with mp4 by copying some of the profiles that are in the folder:

ðŸ—€ Profiles

where there are also profiles to record in full screen, example:

then run clex in a terminal in the main path and see:

hit Enter end the recorder are into the full screen
